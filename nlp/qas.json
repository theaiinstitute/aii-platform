    "what is deep learning?": 
    "Well, deep learning (also known as deep structured learning or hierarchical learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.",
    "what is machine learning?":
    "uhm, machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.",
    "what is bert?":
    "I'm afraid I'm not qualified to answer that.",
    "what does machine learning do?":
    "after my understanding, machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.",
    "what is the algorithm behind neural network?":
    "1st order gradient descent",
    "how does neural network work?":
    "",
    "how to import pytorch?":
    "normally, you should do this by: \n ```python\nimport torch, torchvision\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n"
