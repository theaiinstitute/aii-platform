# AWS - Overview

## Introduction

Cloud Computing is a hot trend nowadays and one of the direct consequences of what we call 'Internet of things'. It's one of the fastest growing domains in technology. And AWS is simply the biggest cloud actor. As of February 2020, AWS is dominating the market with its market share of more or less 32.4%, leaves Microsoft Azure in second position with roughly 17.6% and Google Cloud in 3rd position with only 6%.

## Why should I learn AWS or any Public Cloud in general?

Presently, cloud computing is revolutionizing the technical world. It is an on-demand delivery system which delivers computing power, applications, database storage, and other IT resources. These services are available on-demand or go with pay as you go. More importantly, they offer you all-time availability and easy scalability for your products without borthering you with all the maintenances and security breach fixes as they are handled by the service provider.
